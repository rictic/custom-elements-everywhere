<h4 id="elm-handling-data">Handling data</h4>

Elm passes data in the form you specify. Use `Html.Attributes.attribute` to pass it as an attribute and `Html.Attributes.property` to pass it as a property.

<h4 id="elm-handling-events">Handling events</h4>

Elm can listen to native DOM events dispatched from Custom Elements. It supports all styles of events (lowercase, camelCase, kebab-case, etc).
